# Bio-Digestor Simulator
A bio-digestor simulator for Kudzai Makotore

## Dependencies

The codebase is written in Python 3.10 and and utilises the FastAPI library to expose simulator methods to a React.js web client. This code is designed to run in a  cloud environment but can be run on any machine with Python 3 installed. Depencies can be installed with the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install everything you need to run the simulator. Once installed you can then run:

```
uvicorn main:app --port 8001
```
Of course as of June 1 the code base isn't ready for these magic spells. These commands will come into play from June 3, but you'll never need to run them yourself. The information here is purely for your curiosity Kudzai. The final product will just involve you opening a web browswer.
